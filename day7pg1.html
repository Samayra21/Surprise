  <h1>Hello Future Husband,</h1>
  <p>Ab aaj Kiss day hai kiss ki baat ho rahi hai toh future husband toh bulana banta hai right? <br>I always wished to have that one slow eye to eye contact the build up before the kiss and that first very passionate kiss with just one person that is my only true love in the entire world "MY FUTURE HUSBAND".<br> This may sound kinda lame to you but for me my first kiss is very important. I want it to be very special and with someone very special "YOU".<br> I know you might have to wait a lot and I know you said you have no problem and all but I still wanna say trust me the wait will be worth it... you and I we both will be glad that day that we waited and let our passion for each other increase so much.<br> So abhi yaha zyada baat nai karungi isske baare mai par all I want to say is ab itna wait karliya hai toh thoda aur sahi. At the Right Time we will celebrate our own Kiss Day. <br><br>Till then I know kisses bohot tarah ki hoti hai so we don't have to just think in one way rather we can explore all the other things to show our love to each other.<br><br> Happy Kiss Day Darlinggg ðŸ’‹<br> I LOVE YOU BABYYY ðŸ’‹<br><br> From Yours One and Only,<br>Mumu ðŸ’‹  </p>
