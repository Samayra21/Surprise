        <p id="love-text">Let me start by saying I miss you so damnn much mi amor. I miss being with you, I miss smiling and having fun with you, I miss chatting with you in cubbon park, I miss walking together hands in hands with you, I miss eating and having picnic with you, I miss getting wet in rain with you, I miss resting my head on your shoulders.....<br><br>But mostly I miss those long and tight hugs with you. I miss that romantic feeling of you pulling me towards you and giving me such a tight hug and not letting go of me. I miss seeing those dreamy and comfort face you make like you had experienced a totally different dimension after our hug. Let me tell you that face where your eyes are in peace and in comfort and you have a smile on your face and when you just feel so loved in your expressions that makes me feel so special and so lucky. I feel so glad that you can experience that comfort and peace with me and that you can always see me as your home who you can go to whenever you need.<br><br>I want to hug you so badly right now I cannot even express these feelings in just plain words. I know that we need to be mature and understanding and go according to situations and adjust... but I just can't. I don't want to be understnading, mature and I definitely don't wanna adjust when it comes to you. I want you, you and only you. I cannot live without you. I wanna spend the rest of my life in your arms only. I miss you so so so much and I miss our hugs so badly.<br><br>Meet me soon, I'm waiting and the longer the wait is getting the more unstable my feelings are getting<br><br>Lotsss of lovee and virtual air hugss<br>From Yuvu's Mumu &hearts;</p>
