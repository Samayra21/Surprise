    <div class="message">You are soft and cute just like a teddy bear. I wanna hold you tightly and never let you go. You have the tenderness of a teddy bear that I wanna feel for the rest of my life.<br><br>
     You are just so cute that only by looking at you, my day becomes great. You sending cute lil pics of yours smiling and making me smile. Calling in the morning, asking me about my day, waiting for me every time, all these cute lil efforts you make, I love them and I don't ever want you to stop making them. You are all I have ever wanted. I may fight and irritate you, but I know that in the end I am still going to come back to you and you are going to come back to me.<br><br>
     Even today I was fighting with you but working on this cause I knew we were gonna make up and then I would regret not being consistent with my gift. I Love you and will always love you. I know you feel like I don't understand you. I do and a lot, I see everything. If I can notice and understand my friends and their behaviour, I will definitely understand yours. It's just that I don't trust easily and I feel like no matter how much you know someone, people don't take much time to change as things start going their own way. And that's the exact thing I fear from you. That is why even though I know you might be hurting just as much as me but then again that thought comes that maybe he has changed and he doesn't care much now and that maybe he is enjoying not talking or he doesn't give a shit now, stuff like this.<br><br>
     But I love you and I will always love you. You are the best thing that has happened to me. I just fear... you know why. And you knew this before still you choose to be with me so you have to know that letting this fear go will be hard for me, there is no guarantee that you will stay forever so I do fear a lot.<br><br>
     Love You Cutieee,<br>
